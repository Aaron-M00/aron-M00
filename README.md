# 🤖 Aaron - Full Stack AI/ML Engineer

Hello! I'm Aaron, and I specialize in **Full Stack AI/ML Engineering**. My passion lies in taking machine learning models from **concept to production**—building the entire pipeline from the data layer all the way up to the user-facing application.

---

### 🧠 What I Do

My expertise spans the entire development stack, focusing on creating intelligent, scalable, and robust systems:

* **Machine Learning (ML) Development:** I design, train, and optimize ML models (including deep learning) for various tasks like prediction, classification, and generation. My focus is on **performance** and **resource efficiency**.
* **Backend Engineering:** I architect and build **API services** (often using Python/FastAPI or Node.js) to serve ML model predictions in real-time or via batch processing. I focus on **scalability**, **latency**, and **data integrity**.
* **Data Engineering:** I manage the crucial **data pipelines**—handling data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and storage (SQL/NoSQL/Cloud storage) to ensure high-quality data is available for model training and inference.
* **Frontend Development:** I build the **user interfaces** (usually using frameworks like React or Vue) that interact seamlessly with the backend services, enabling users to leverage the AI/ML features directly.
* **MLOps & Deployment:** I implement **CI/CD** and containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) strategies to reliably deploy, monitor, and maintain ML models in **cloud environments** (AWS, GCP, Azure).
